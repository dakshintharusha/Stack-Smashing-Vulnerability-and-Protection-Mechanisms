# Stack-Smashing-Vulnerability-and-Protection-Mechanisms

Rapid growth of technology and huge amount of 
attack surfaces available in the world paves the way to adversaries 
to leverage the existing technology and exploiting systems by 
carrying out highly sophisticated attacks. With compared to them 
naïve, but still commonly used attack type is stack smashing 
attack. There intruders inject sophisticated malicious opcodes to 
the stack and obtain the control flow of the vulnerable program 
which eventually leads to compromise the underlying system and 
allows attackers to run arbitrary code in an unauthorized manner 
without legitimate users’ intervention or consent. Return address, 
stack frame pointer, pointers, arrays of pointers, arrays of 
characters are well known attack targets used by adversaries and 
on the other hand ASLR, non-executable stack, canary values, use 
of memory safe languages and static codes analysis are some 
protection mechanisms used to defend against stack smashing 
vulnerability. In this paper what is stack smashing attack, tactics 
and techniques used to perform attacks and countermeasures 
against them have been discussed.
